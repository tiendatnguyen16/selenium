# selenium
## The purpose of this repo
* To practice Selenium with the help of AIs so I can learn faster, and less boring while reading documentations
* I can also practice using Markdown here, which is cool
  * two spaces indentation then a "*" will create a child bullet point
  * After that another child bullet point will be automatically created, as it's two spaces indented, work the same like in Microsoft Word
  * *a tab* cannot be used to create a child bullet point, two tabs will do
## getAllAnchors.js  
### How to use this?  
* First you need to manually inspect the anchor by highlighting it, then get the path, the heading levels do not mean anything, just select one.
* The one on top is the heading level 1.
