# selenium
## The purpose of this repo
* To practice Selenium with the help of AIs so I can learn faster, and less boring while reading documentations
## getAllAnchors.js  
### How to use this?  
* First you need to manually inspect the anchor by highlighting it, then get the path, the heading levels do not mean anything, just select one.
* The one on top is the heading level 1.
